# ImmutableJs
Getting started with immutable js

I encountered with immutable JS while working for a project in my organization.Since then it has left me messmerized.
This repo is quick nack, which talks in small samples, about the usage of immutableJS.
I have added descriptions for each tests, which talks about the usage and features immutableJS data structures provide.
Example: On running a sample the result displayed would be something like below:
  
    Exploring Sequences()  and Range() in Immutable JS
    ✓ should see Seq() act like an iterable
    ✓ Seq is lazy
    ✓ should not produce overflow with Immutable.Range
    ✓ should demonstrate chaining with Seq()
  
How to get started:
1. Check out the code.
2. Issue the command npm install.
3. To see what each program/smaple does, issue the command "mocha <sample_name>".
